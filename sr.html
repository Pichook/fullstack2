    <p> Siem Reap is a cheerful city that embraces travelers like old friends. This region was the site of successive capitals of the Khmer Empire from the ninth to the 15th centuries. The ruins, collectively 
        known as the Angkor Archaeological Park, are located about four miles north of the city center.</p>
